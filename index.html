        One of the most unique word that I've known in my life is the word
        <i><b>Grit</b></i
        >. It is a word that suits people who are striving in order to achieve
        their dreams and goals in life. <i><b>Grit</b></i> is passion, courage
        and perseverance in one word. That's why I decided to start a business
        in clothing and name it with the word <i><b>Grit</b></i
        >. It's a simple word yet it has a lot of meaning.It represents an
        individual's ability to strive harder and maintain a focus on long term
        goals. It is the tenacity to overcome challenges and setbacks, fueled by
        deep passion for what one aims to achieve. <i><b>Grit</b></i> goes
        beyond innate talent and intelligence, emphasizing the importance of
        hard work and resilience. The gritty individual understands that success
        is a marathon, not a sprint and is willing to endure pain and discomfort
        to reach the finish line. <i><b>Grit</b></i> involves sustained effort
        over time, and its improvement requires a mentality that embraces
        challenges as a part of journey. That's why this word is really
        meaningful to me because it kinda summarizes the story of my life. It
        takes grit to reach my dreams and I'm still on the marathon where the
        finish line is still far ahead.
